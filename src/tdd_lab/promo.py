"""Promo-code pricing -- the feature you will build with TDD (Red-Green-Refactor).

Business rules (from the product owner):

* ``SAVE10``  - 10% off the subtotal (round the discount DOWN to a whole cent).
* ``FLAT5``   - $5.00 off, but only when the subtotal is at least $20.00.
* ``WELCOME`` - 15% off, valid only on or before 2026-12-31.
* Codes are case-insensitive and surrounding whitespace is ignored.
* An unknown, expired, or ineligible code must raise ``PromoError`` -- never
  silently return the full price.
* The total can never go below zero.

All money is integer cents. Dates are ``datetime.date``.

Right now this is only a stub. Write failing tests FIRST (Red), then make them
pass (Green), then clean up (Refactor).
